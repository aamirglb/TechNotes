# Visual Studio Code

* Visual Studio Code is based on `Electron` (https://electronjs.org/), a framework for creating cross-platform applications with native technologies, and combines the simplicity of a powerful code editor with the tools a developer needs to support the application life cycle development, including debuggers and version control integration based on Git.

* `ASP.NET` Core, the cross-platform, open source technology able to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS that Microsoft produced to create portable web applications.

* Core features of VS Code
    * Built-in support for coding with many languages
    * Built-in debugger for `Node.js`, with support for additional debuggers (such as .NET Core and Mono) via extensibility
    * Version control based on the popular Git engine

* Visual Studio Code provides a coding environment based on folders, which makes it easy to work with code files that are not organized within projects and offers a unified way to work with different languages.

* User interface is divided into five areas: the `code editor`, the `status bar`, the `activity bar`, `panels area`, and the `side bar`.

* You can quickly switch between editors by pressing `Ctrl + 1`, `2`, and `3`.

* Press `Ctrl+Tab` to list all open files in command palette, press Tab again to browse the list of open files.

* zoom in and out the active editor by clicking `Ctrl++` and `Ctrl+-` respectively

* status bar color changes depending on the situation. For example, it is `violet` when you open a single file, `blue` when you open a folder, and `orange` when Visual Studio Code is in debugging mode.

* The `OUTLINE` group provides a hierarchical view of types and members defined within a code file or of tags within defined in a markup file.

* The Git icon also shows the number of files that have been modified locally.

* for Navigate sequencital tabs `Ctrl+PageUp` and `Ctrl+PageDown`

* Command Palette is another very important tool in Visual Studio Code, which allows for accessing Visual Studio Code built-in commands and also commands added by extensions via the keyboard.

* Open Command Palette via the `Ctrl+Shift+P` keyboard shortcut.

* `Microsoft C#` free extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) provides an optimized experience
for .NET Core development and includes all the support and tools you need to build apps with C#, including the necessary support for the .NET Core debugger.

* advanced editing capabilities based on the .NET Compiler
Platform (also known as `Roslyn`) that makes it easier to fix code issues as you type.

* press `Ctrl+D` to fast select a word or identifier at the right of the cursor.

* Multicursors, add secondary cursors by pressing `Alt-Click` at the desired position.

* Emmet abbreviation syntax for built-in code snippets that you can
easily add.

* Visual Studio Code provides the `Minimap`, a small preview of the source code file on the code editorâ€™s scrollbar.

* A `breadcrumb` navigation lets you jump to symbols and files in your workspace from the top without having to mess around with the file explorer; most helpful for small screens.

* For markdown preview press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Cmd+Shift+V on macOS)
in the code editor, and the preview will appear in a separate window.
