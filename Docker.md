# Docker

* **Docker** is a platform for running applications in an _isolated environment_ called a **_"container"_** (or Docker container). 

* Applications like Jenkins can be downloaded as read-only "images" (or Docker images), each of which is run in Docker as a container. 

* A Docker container is in effect a "running instance" of a Docker image. From this perspective, an image is stored permanently more or less (i.e. insofar as image updates are published), whereas containers are stored temporarily. 

* Dockerâ€™s fundamental platform and container design means that a single Docker image (for any given application like Jenkins) can be run on any supported operating system (macOS, Linux and Windows) or cloud service (AWS and Azure) which is also running Docker.
