# PHP

* **PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor)** is one of the most popular languages used for web application development.

* First release in 1995 as a **Personal Home Page Tool (PHP)** by Rasmus Lerdorf

* Offical website [www.php.net](www.php.net)

* Server Stack Packages
    * **WAMP** (Windows, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP),
    * **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP),
    * **MAMP** (Mac, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP)

* PHP 7 also replaces fatal errors, which previously would crash a program, with
exceptions that can be handled within the program itself.

* using Facebook’s HHVM (Hip Hop Virtual Machine) which converts PHP code into C++
code which can then be executed for better performance.

* With the introduction of PHP 8, code is compiled using a JIT (just-in-time) compiler.

* The `@` operator, which you may have seen in older PHP code, is removed.

* JavaScript code is downloaded to the user’s computer. It is interpreted and executed
within the _browser_. PHP code resides on a web server. The code is also interpreted and
executed, but within the _web server_, not by the browser.

* There are many web servers that will work with PHP and MySQL/MariaDB databases.
    * _Microsoft Internet Information Server_ (IIS): www.iis.net/
    * _Lighttpd_: www.lighttpd.net/
    * _NGINX_: www.nginx.com/ (event-driven, good for static pages)
    * _Apache_: www.apache.org/ (process-driven, good for dynamic pages)

* AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) provides
the ability to dynamically change portions of a web page without reloading the complete page.
