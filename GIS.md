# Geospatial Development

* The term **geospatial** refers to finding information that is located on the earth's surface.

* geospatial data is represented as a series of **coordinates**, often in the form of latitude and longitude values. Additional attributes, such as temperature, soil type, height, or the name of a landmark, are also often present.

* A **Projection** is a way of representing the earth's surface in two dimensions (2D). Every piece of geospatial data has a projection associated with it.

* PostGIS spatially-enabled database toolkit

* geocode location using:

* To find the location of Coit Tower, San Francisco
http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q="Coit Tower, San Francisco, CA"

* **Mash-ups** are applications that combine data and functionality from more than one source. 

* Google Map, Mapnik, OpenLayers, and MapServer allow you to create mash-ups that overlay own data onto a map.

* Tools such as PROJ.4, PostGIS, OGR, and GDAL are all excellent geospatial toolkits

* The Open Geospatial Consortium (http://www.opengeospatial.org) is an international standards organization that aims to define standard formats and protocols for sharing and storing geospatial data.

* These standards, including GML, KML, GeoRSS, WMS, WFS and WCS.

* GIS (Geographic Information Systems). In GIS we deal with _mathematical model_ of the Earth's surface. Representing points, lines and areas on the surface of the Earth is a rather complicated process.
