# WxWidget

* `wxWidgets` has bindings for a variety of other languages such as Python, Perl, a BASIC variant, Lua, Eiffel, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Haskell, and C#. Some of these bindings are more
advanced than others.

* **DialogBlocks** is a sizer-based resource editor that quickly gets you creating professional-looking dialogs, wizards and frames for deployment on Windows, Linux, Mac or any other supported wxWidgets platform.

* wxWidgets is a programmer’s toolkit for writing desktop or mobile applications
with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It’s a _framework_, in the sense that
it does a lot of the housekeeping work and provides default application behavior.

* wxWidgets provides classes for files and streams, multiple threads, application
settings, interprocess communication, online help, database access, and
much more.

* wxWidgets provides a native look
and feel. wxWidgets uses the native widgets wherever possible (and
its own widget set in other cases) so that not only does the application look
native on the major platforms, but it actually is native.

* Initially,
wxWidgets targeted XView and MFC 1.0; Borland C++ users complained
about the requirement for MFC, so it was rewritten to use pure Win32.
Because XView was giving way to Motif, a Motif port quickly followed.

* Wolfram Gloger suggested that wxWidgets should be ported to GTK+,
the up-and-coming widget set being adopted for the GNOME desktop environment.

* Robert Roebling became the lead developer for wxGTK, which is now
the main Unix/Linux port of wxWidgets.

* wxUniversal, wxWidgets’s own set of widgets for use on platforms
A Brief History of wxWidgets 5
that have no widget set of their own. wxUniversal was first used in SciTech’s
port to MGL, their low-level graphics layer.

* In 2002, Julian Smart and Robert Roebling added the wxX11 port using
the wxUniversal widgets. Requiring only Unix and X11, wxX11 is suitable for
any Unix environment and can be used in fairly low-spec systems.

* The object-oriented language Smalltalk
designed by Alan Kay and others in the 1970s was an important milestone in
GUI history, making innovations in user interface technology as well as language
design, and although wxWidgets uses a different language and API, the
principles employed are broadly the same.
